# AnInterpreter
This is my second attempt at writing an interpreter. While my last attempt was more of a stack based bytecode (hence the name StackInterpreter), this is more of a full fledged language supporting variables and if statements.

# Usage
`python3 interpreter.py d filename.adb` Debug mode with a colored output!
`python3 interpreter.py dc filename.adb` Debug mode without a colored output.
`python3 interpreter.py r filename.adb` Interpret without debug.
